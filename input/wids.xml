    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      This Extended Package (EP) describes security requirements for a Wireless Intrusion/Prevention System (WIDS/WIPS)
      (defined to be a IEEE 802.11 network intrusion prevention product located at the edge of a private network that 
      can collect, inspect, analyze, and react to network traffic in real-time) and is intended to provide a minimal 
      baseline set of requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described threats. This EP is not 
      complete in itself, but rather extends either the collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices (NDcPP). 
      This introduction will describe the features of a compliant Target of Evaluation (TOE), and will also discuss 
      how this EP is to be used in conjunction with the NDcPP.

         The collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices (NDcPP) defines the baseline Security 
         Functional Requirements (SFRs) and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) for network infrastructure
         devices in general. This EP serves to extend the baseline set by either the NDcPP, with additional 
         SFRs and associated ‘Assurance Activities’ specific to <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> devices. Assurance Activities are 
         the actions that the evaluator performs in order to determine a TOE’s compliance to the SFRs.
         <h:br/><h:br/>
         This EP is conformant to Parts 2 (extended) and 3 (extended) of Common Criteria
         Version 3.1, Revision 4 <cite linkend="bibCC"/>.

   <section title="How to Use This Extended Package" id="Usage">
     As an EP of the NDcPP it is expected that the content of both this EP and the base PP be appropriately 
       combined in the context of each product-specific Security Target. This EP has been specifically defined 
       such that there should be no difficulty or ambiguity in so doing. An ST must identify the applicable 
       version of the NDcPP (see http://www.niap-ccevs.org/pp/ for the current version) and this EP in its 
       conformance claims. 
   </section>


    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      This EP specifically addresses Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS). A conformant 
      <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> is a product that provides network security administrators with the ability to monitor, collect,
      log, and react in real-time to potentially malicious network traffic.  A WIDS typically consists of multiple
      sensors that passively scan their surrounding RF environment on the WLAN radio frequency spectrum for 
      IEEE 802.11 traffic and a centralized mechanism such as a Server or Controller that processes the data 
      collected by the sensors. The <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> could use an Embedded (be part of the WLAN infrastructure) or 
      Overlay (independent from WLAN) architecture depending on vendor implementation.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      This EP is focused on inspecting layers 1 and 2 of the OSI network model as the traffic that the WIDS/WIPS 
      will monitor will be wireless frames and RF spectrum for IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, and ac. Requirements for other 
      technologies (i.e., cellular) and protocols are optional.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      Conformant TOEs will detect potentially malicious network traffic using various approaches. Broadly speaking,
      the traffic analysis could be based on identification of ‘known’ threats, or ‘unknown’ threats. Identification 
      of ‘known’ threats may be performed through pattern matching, e.g. by matching strings of characters within a frame,
      or by matching traffic patterns common with reconnaissance or denial of service (DoS) attacks. Identification of 
      ‘unknown’ threats may be performed through use of various forms of ‘anomaly’ detection whereby the <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> is 
      provided with (or ‘learns’/creates) a definition of ‘expected/typical’ traffic patterns, such that it’s able to 
      detect and react to ’anomalous’ (unexpected/atypical) traffic patterns.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      The following are to be part of the evaluation:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Monitoring, detection and reporting capabilities offered by the <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/>.</h:li>
        <h:li>Use of secure communication paths between <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> components</h:li>
        <h:li>Use of secure communication paths for <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> management and event monitoring.</h:li>
        <h:li>Use of secure communication paths with external components (e.g., database and log server)</h:li>
      </h:ul> <h:br/>

    </section>
  
  </chapter>  
  
  <chapter title="Security Problem Definition" id="spd">
    <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> address a range of security threats related to detection of and reaction to potentially malicious WLAN 
    traffic. The malicious traffic may pose a threat to one or more endpoints on the monitored networks, or to the 
    network infrastructure, or to the TOE itself. Attacks against a WLAN could compromise the confidentiality and 
    integrity of WLAN user and system data as well as the availability of the WLAN to legitimate users. <h:br/><h:br/> 
    
    The term “monitored network” is used here to represent any WLAN that the TOE is configured to monitor and detect 
    intrusions on.  The terms “WiFi Network” and “WLAN” will be used interchangeably to represent an IEEE 802.11 network.<h:br/> <h:br/> 
    
    The proper installation, configuration, and administration of the <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> are critical to its correct operation. 
    A site is responsible for developing its security policy and configuring a rule set that the <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> will enforce 
    and provide an appropriate response to meet their needs, relative to their own risk analysis and their perceived threats.<h:br/><h:br/> 
    
    Note that this EP does not repeat the threats identified in the NDcPP, though they all apply given the conformance 
    and hence dependence of this EP on the NDcPP. Note also that while the NDcPP contains only threats to the ability of
    the TOE to provide its security functions, this EP addresses only threats to resources in the operational environment. 
    Together the threats of the NDcPP and those defined in this EP define the comprehensive set of security threats 
    addressed by a <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/> TOE.

    <h:p>This EP does not define any SARs beyond those defined within the NDcPP. It is important 
      to note that a TOE that is evaluated against this EP is inherently evaluated against NDcPP. 
      When evaluating the TOE, it is necessary to apply the SARs defined for the base PP to the 
      entire TOE and not just the portion that is described by the base PP.</h:p>   
  </chapter>

  
  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> 
    As indicated in <secref linkend="ConformanceClaims"/>,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr linkend="WIDS/WIPS"/>) are
    contained in the body of this PP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements
    specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
      linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for a WIDS/WIPS to claim conformance to
    this PP. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements based on selections
    in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that
    appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this PP, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this PP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in
    <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/>
    but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the ST. 
  </appendix>

  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based"> As indicated in the introduction to
    this PP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS or its underlying
    platform) are contained in the body of this PP. There are additional requirements based on
    selections in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements
    below will need to be included. 
  </appendix>

  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This appendix includes requirements that 
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently 
    mandated in the body of this PP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available 
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the 
    WIDS/WIPS is still conformant to this PP. It is expected that these requirements will transition 
    from objective requirements to baseline requirements in future versions of this EP.
