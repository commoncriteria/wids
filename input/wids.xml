  <!-- 3.0 Security Problem Definition-->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
    <h:p>A Network Device has a network infrastructure role that it is designed to provide. In doing so,
	the Network Device communicates with other Network Devices and other network entities (i.e.
	entities not defined as Network Devices because they do not have an infrastructure role) over
	the network. At the same time, it must provide a minimal set of common security functionality
	expected by all Network Devices. The security problem to be addressed by a compliant
	Network Device is defined as this set of common security functionality that addresses the
	threats that are common to Network Devices, as opposed to those that might be targeting the
	specific functionality of a specific type of Network Device. The set of common security
	functionality addresses communication with the Network Device, both authorized and
	unauthorized, the ability to perform valid and secure updates, the ability to audit device activity,
	the ability to securely store and utilize device and Administrator credentials and data, and the
	ability to self-test critical device components for failures.</h:p>

    <sec:Security_Assurance_Requirements title="Security Assurance Requirements">
      The Security Objectives in
      <xref to="Security_Objectives"/>
      were constructed to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
      in
      <xref to="SFRs"/>
      are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing.
      <h:br/>
      This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
       to be performed are specified both in
      <xref to="SFRs"/>
      as well as in this section.
      <h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:
      <h:br/>
      After the
        ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within
      <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in
      <xref to="SFRs"/>
      also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.
      <section title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">
        As per ASE activities
        defined in
        <xref to="bibCEM"/>.
      </section>
      <section title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">
        The information about the OS is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the TSS portion of the ST. The OS developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in
        <xref to="SFRs"/>
        should provide the ST authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.
        <a-component cc-id="adv_fsp.1" name="Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)">
          The
          functional specification describes the TSFI. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

            <note role="application">As indicated in the introduction to this section, the
              functional specification is comprised of the information contained in the AGD_OPE and
              AGD_PRE documentation. The developer may reference a website accessible to application

              The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the
              <xref to="bibCEM"/>
              and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities.
              <h:br/>
              While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform.
              <h:br/>
              This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results.
              <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.

        For the first generation of
        this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to discover
        what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most cases, these
        vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until
        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the OS. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

            <aactivity>
              The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses. 
              The evaluator documents the sources consulted and
              the vulnerabilities found in the report.
              <h:br/>
              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.
