<!-- SME REVIEW ITEMS 9/17/20 
1. Review changes to TOE objectives and to SFR-objective mappings+rationale. 

The following issues were resolved:
a. O.WIPS_REACT changed to O.WIDS_REACT, with modifications to description - this was done because all TOE objectives
must map to at least one mandatory SFR.

b. FAU_WIP_EXT.1 still mapped to O.WIDS_REACT but also added the following:
  - FMT_SMF.1/WIDS
  - FAU_ANO_EXT.1
  - FAU_ARP.1
  - FAU_SAA.1

c. added mapping of O.TRUSTED_COMMUNICATIONS to T.UNAUTHORIZED_DISCLOSURE_OF_INFORMATION (objective was previously
unmapped)

d. slight change to description of T.UNAUTHORIZED_DISCLOSURE_OF_INFORMATION to accommodate mapped objective

e. O.INSECURE_OPERATIONS removed and FPT_FLS.1 re-mapped to O.TOE_ADMINISTRATION and O.TOE_MONITORING
(an objective cannot be met solely with non-mandatory SFRs)

f. wording of O.TOE_ADMINISTRATION and O.SYSTEM_MONITORING updated slightly to accommodate FPT_FLS.1 being mapped to them


2. Review updates to FAU_WID_EXT.2 - TD0306 made 4.9 GHz non-mandatory so that was repeated here. Additionally,
4.9 GHz testing was not previously present in the test EAs.


3. Review updates to FAU_RPT_EXT.1 (formerly FAU_GEN_EXT.1) test activities - the previous version
implied certain tests were mandatory despite the functions being in selections

   - Push # 1: Added WLAN Definition
   - Push # 2: Comments: Lauren - I identified the purpose behind "FAU_GEN.2(WIDS) Alerts Data Generation (WIDS/WIPS)"" table we had questions about yesterday, and I've changed my opinion about it usefullness. 
                      I now support it's inclusion for the following reason (please argue against if you think I'm missing something here):

                      The "FAU_SAA.1 Potential Violation Analysis - Potential Security Violations" table simply labels the types of auditable events the TSF should trigger off of, and whether it's a mandatory,
                       objective, or optional SFR.  Applying a set of rules for monitoring the wireless traffic, and based upon these rules, indicating a potential malicious action is different than actually identifying 
                       what information should be contanied within the triggered alert. If an event is triggerable, the "FAU_GEN.2(WIDS) Alerts Data Generation (WIDS/WIPS)" table specifically identifies what 
                      attributes (i.e. MAC address, SSID, signal strength, BSSID) should be captured and contained within the alert, and then eventually parsed and displayed by a reporting mechanism (e.g. SIEM, 
                      syslog, 3rd party solution). This table sperately provides a space within the mudule to define the specific device and event attributes that should be monitored for and captured 
                      within a triggerable event. Not all of the SFRs trigger an actual alert, hence why some requirements within the table have "None" specified under the "Auditable Events" column.

                      Let me know if you see and holes in my logic and understanding.

 Arnolds Comments
 1. Title: Specify 802.11 WIDS/WIPS
 2. Section 1: Plance 802.11 in front of Wireless Intrusion Detection System
 3. Section 1.1: Added "in addition to the 802.11 WIDS capability" to  statement
 4. Section 1.2.2: Add 802.11 to "AP, "EUD", and "WLAN" definitions
 5. Section 1.3.1: Replace Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention System with "WIDS/WIPS"
 6. Section 1.3.1: Change the word "Overlay" to "Standalone"
 7. Section 1.3.1 - 3: Corrected 3 punctuation errors
 8. Section 3: Removed the last sentence reference the to "Wi-Fi" spelling variances/permutations. 
 Change everything instance of "Wi-Fi" (2) to "WLAN"


Lauren's Notes:
Q: does the EUD have to make a connection attempt to any network for the WIDS to see it? Or will the WIDS see it if it is just powered on? 
Response: The WIDS will detect any EUD that's powered on, within geospacial range, and emitting probe requests; regardless of connection status.

Q: Is an unauthorized SSID being broadcasted by an authorized AP different than if it was broadcasted from an unauthorized AP?
Response: Yes, this would imply two different scenarios; one being a threat and the other being a compromise. An unauthorized SSID being broadcast from an unauthorized AP would indicate a possible masquerade or deauth attempt. An unauthorized SSID being broadcast from an authorized AP would indicate either a malfunction in the authorized AP, a compromised AP, or a spoofed or rogue AP present within the WLAN.

  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview title="Overview">
      <h:p>This Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) describes
      security requirements for a 802.11 Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) defined to be an
      IEEE 802.11 network intrusion detection product located at the edge of a private network that
      can collect, inspect, and analyze real-time network traffic and alert the administrator of
      policy violations. This PP-Module is intended to provide a minimal baseline set of
      requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described threats.</h:p>
      <h:p>This PP-Module contains optional requirements for a Wireless Intrusion
      Protection System (WIPS), a security product that in addition to the 802.11 WIDS capability,
      provides network security administrators with the additional ability to react in real-time to
      potentially malicious wireless (IEEE 802.11) network traffic.</h:p>
      <h:p>
        This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <h:ul>
          <h:li>Network Device collaborative Protection Profile Version 4.0 </h:li>
        </h:ul>
      </h:p>
      <h:p>A TOE that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module must be a 'Distributed TOE' as defined in the NDcPP. 
      The expectation for this PP-Module is that a WIDS must include distributed sensor nodes to ensure that the full physical range of a wireless network
      to ensure that user interactions with the network cannot evade detection.</h:p>

        <h:p>This PP-Module specifically addresses
        WIDS/WIPS. A conformant WIDS is a product that can monitor, collect, inspect, and analyze
        real-time network traffic and alert the administrator of policy violations. WIPS
        functionality is not required to conform to this PP-Module, and it is optional for the TOE
        to have the additional ability to react in real-time to potentially malicious wireless (IEEE
        802.11) network traffic.</h:p>
        <h:p>A WIDS/WIPS TOE consists of multiple sensors that
        passively scan the RF environment on the WLAN radio frequency spectrum and a centralized
        mechanism such as a Server or Controller that processes the data collected by the sensors.
        Conformant TOEs must use a secure communication path(s) between WIDS/WIPS components.</h:p>
        <h:p>
          A WIDS/WIPS can be Integrated (be part of the WLAN infrastructure) or
        Standalone (independent from WLAN) architecture depending on vendor implementation. The two
        different architectures are illustrated in
          <xref to="toe"/>
          below. The TOE
        boundary is indicated by the yellow box.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>A WIDS/WIPS is expected to inspect layers 1 and 2 network traffic, per the
        OSI network model, and monitor wireless frames in the RF spectrum utilized by IEEE 802.11 a,
        b, g, n, and ac. Monitoring and inspection of other technologies (e.g., cellular) and
        protocols are optional.</h:p>
        <h:p>Conformant TOEs will detect potentially malicious
        network traffic using various approaches. Broadly speaking, the traffic analysis could be
        based on identification of 'known' threats, or 'unknown' threats. Identification of 'known'
        threats may be performed through pattern matching, (e.g. by matching strings of characters
        within a frame with known patterns, or by matching traffic patterns common with
        reconnaissance or denial of service (DoS) attacks). Identification of 'unknown' threats may
        be performed through use of various forms of anomaly detection whereby the WIDS/WIPS is
        provided with (or learns/creates) a definition of expected/typical traffic patterns, such
        that it’s able to detect and react to anomalous (unexpected/atypical) traffic patterns.</h:p>

            <h:p>A WIDS consists of sensors (preferably dedicated) and a central controller working together to provide 24/7 monitoring, primarily to the

            <h:p>The WIDS may be capable of detecting or monitoring traffic other than 802.11 WLAN, such as

          A WIDS monitors all 802.11 WLAN traffic emanating from and traversing the controlled space, thus inadvertent collection of any 802.11

  <!-- 3.0 Security Problem Definition-->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Definition>
    <h:p>WIDS address a range of security threats
    related to detection of and reaction to potentially malicious WLAN traffic. The malicious
    traffic may pose a threat to one or more endpoints on the monitored networks, to the network
    infrastructure, or to the TOE itself. Attacks against a WLAN could compromise the
    confidentiality and integrity of WLAN users and system data as well as the availability of the
    WLAN to legitimate users.</h:p>
    <h:p>
      The term “monitored network” is used here to represent
    any WLAN and/or wired network that the TOE is configured to monitor and detect intrusions on.
    This extends to the wired networks as intrusions on the wireless network can also be damaging to
    the wired infrastructure. The WIDS/WIPS also protect the wired infrastructure by detecting rogue
    devices that are directly connected to the wired infrastructure, which may expose the wired
    network, or unauthorized WLAN devices deployed in a no-wireless zone.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The proper installation, configuration, and administration of the WIDS is critical to
    its correct operation. A site is responsible for developing its security policy and configuring
    a rule set that the WIDS will enforce and provide an appropriate response to meet their needs,
    relative to their own risk analysis and their perceived threats.
    </h:p>
    <h:p>Note that this
    PP-Module does not repeat the threats identified in the NDcPP, though they all apply given the
    conformance and hence dependence of this PP-Module on the NDcPP. Note also that while the NDcPP
    contains only threats to the ability of the TOE to provide its security functions, this
    PP-Module addresses only threats to resources in the operational environment. Together the
    threats of the NDcPP and those defined in this PP-Module define the comprehensive set of
    security threats addressed by a WIDS TOE.</h:p>

                If the TSF uses a separate database server to support its security-relevant functionality, this selection must be included in the ST.
              The intent of the database server is to store WIDS/WIPS data that must be queryable, such as events/alarms, triangulation calculations, 
              wireless spectrum analysis (including RF jammer/Denial of Service (DoS)), and packet capture analysis. Authorized Administrators must be permitted to view alarms, 
              raw event data, and any other data stored in the database. The Administrator must access the database through a trusted channel if done so remotely.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>The intent of this requirement is to provide a means by which a cryptographic protocol may be used to protect external communications 
              with authorized IT entities that the TOE interacts with to perform its functions. The TOE uses at least one of the listed protocols for 
              communications with the server that collects the audit information.</h:p>
              <h:p>If other authorized IT entities are protected, the ST author makes the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections 
              (for the protocols that are used to protect those connections). The ST author selects the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE, 
              and then ensures that the detailed protocol requirements in Appendix B of NDcPP corresponding to their selection are included in the ST.</h:p>

        <h:td>CC Part 2 specifies FDP_IFF.1 as a dependency of FDP_IFC.1 because the TSF must define the information flow control SFP rules associated with a given SFP. 
          This dependency is implicitly addressed through FAU_WID_EXT.2, which defines the rules for the 802.11 monitoring SFP defined by FDP_IFC.1.</h:td>

  <appendix title="Allocation of Requirements in Distributed TOEs" id="allocation">
    For a distributed TOE, the security functional requirements in this PP-Module need to be met by the
      TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be implemented by all components. The
      following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a
      component:
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>
        <h:b>All Components ("All")</h:b>
        - All components that comprise the distributed TOE must
        independently satisfy the requirement.
      </h:li>
      <h:li>
        <h:b>At least one Component ("One")</h:b>
        - This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one
        component within the distributed TOE.
      </h:li>
      <h:li>
        <h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent")</h:b>
        - These requirements will only be
      fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed TOE component (note
      that the requirement to meet the PP-Module as a whole requires that at least one component
      implements these requirements if they are claimed by the TOE).
      </h:li>
    </h:ul>
    The table below specifies how each of the SFRs in this PP-Module must be met, using the categories above.
